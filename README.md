<b>What is the efficacy of VR when learning about the past? Does the use of multisensory effects increase user learning?</b>

Broken into various folders. Assets is where the exciting things are. For markers, you will find my scripts under Assets/Scripts . The 
web folder was completed before the project began.

Most assets in the screen were modelled by me, the Cautes and Cautopates statues were created by Albert Folgia
and the scans of the statue was provided by Newcastle University. The folder Assets/EffectExamples was free from the Unity asset store as was the
folder Assets/Fantasy Wooden GUI Free.

I use VRTK, Oculus SDK, and Oculus Avatar.

Best way to experience it is using an Oculus Rift HMD, but you can also just use a Windows machine. 

Without an HMD grabbing objects is hard (grab with 'g' button) and to click the button on the screen (base, play, or quit) you have to press F4 first to stop the camera.

<b>Directions to play on PC:</b> The first scene you press the Base button on the computer scene with the mouse, then you get put in a photogrammetry model, you can move with WASD and look around but no further interaction yet. Press F4 to then press the Play button. Inside this the task is to  light the temple (but not sure how to do this without VR) but there are various 'sound zones' where the different torches are. Wait till Mithras stops speaking to go to the next area.

<b>Directions to play on Rift:</b>The first scene you press the button on the computer scene with the mouse, then you get put in a photogrammetry model, you should be able to teleport with the trigger, and I think grab the cubes on the altars with the grip button. Then once finished with that you can press the button with mouse on computer scene to start the 'real' experience. Where you need to light the temple. You press the trigger to teleport and can grab objects (such as bowls) with grip button. However, don't move when the god voice is speaking otherwise the audio will play over each other becauseI cannot figure out how to write a list or queue of audio.
